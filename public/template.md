This project is a pre-requisite for CMU course 18562, which students are required to complete prior to the start of the semester. The project is a simple web-based chat room (there is only one chat room, and all registered users chat in one place).

This project must be completed strictly **independently**, no additional features can be added, so it is just a simple chat room. The following is the interface design of the chat room provided by the professor.

The project is relatively simple, just a simple user login and registration, and then set the session. 
The only new technology for me is WebSocket, which is required for live chat, but it's relatively simple to implement. Here's how it works.

Note that the chat history is in Chinese since I tested the project with my friend.
